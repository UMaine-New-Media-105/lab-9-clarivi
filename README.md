This Lab Exercise was all about learing how to loops, arrays, objects, and classes to create moving, bouncing shapes.

In the first exercise , we used Javascript Classes to create a shape, and gave that class a method for displaying the shape on the screen. The sketch can be found at: https://editor.p5js.org/connorL/sketches/Ro-RqSJ-H

In the second exercise, we made that shape move and bounce off the walls and ceilings. I decided to make a triangle, with the plan of having it bounce certain ways when hitting certain edges. On the left and right walls, the triangle bounces up and to the opposite direction, and on the ceiling, they lose all of their horizontal speed and bounce directly downward. Then, when they reach the bottom they gain speed based on their distance from the center of the width of the screen. the sketch can be found here: https://editor.p5js.org/connorL/sketches/0H1FZx6w0

In the third exercise, we created 50 shapes that moved identically using arrays and loops. I gave the triangles a pastel color palette, and also made them speed up vertically when they bounce off a wall. They are limited to about 2 times their base speed so that it does not get out of hand. The sketch can be found here: https://editor.p5js.org/connorL/sketches/6T8K2JDbh
